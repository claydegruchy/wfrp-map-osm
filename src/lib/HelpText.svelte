  <h4>What is this?</h4>

  <p>
    This is a searchable Warhammer world map inspired by the amazing maps over
    at gitzmansgallery. I didn't make any of these maps, just put them together.

  <h4>Credits</h4>

    Big thanks to gitzmansgallery for the main map. Extract from

      Some original artwork is credited to Andreas Blicher, based upon Alfred
      Nunez Jr.'s outstanding cartography and research. Many other sources were
      used including those from the Warhammer Maps page.

    Thanks to Magnus Seter via http://altdorfer.blogspot.com for Altdorf. I hope
    to load the various POIs one day.

    Big thanks to{" "}
    <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/planjanusza"> planjanusza</a>
    {" "} for the free listed assets on their deviantart. Amazing stuff and inspired
    me to make this. Multiple maps are used from here.
  </p>
  <h4>Who are you?</h4>
  <h4>Why did you make this?</h4>

  <p>
    I wanted to learn QGIS, I wanted to learn react, and I like warhammer, so I
    made this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally I wanted to make a system that would let people share maps and
    crowdsource the world but I had some pretty bad community interactions which
    made me shy on the idea, plus turns out I don't like react.
  </p>

  <p>Now I mostly use it as a personal tool for my campaigns.</p>

  <h4>>I think this looks like shit</h4>

  <p>
    That's just like your opinion, man. Put in a commit if you want to change
    something, its open source.
  </p>

  <h4>Why is there really bad looking AI art in here?</h4>

  <p>
    I used AI art in some games with my group in 2023, and loaded it into the
    map for easier finding. It was a different time.
  </p>

  <h4>I have a high def map of a city/part of the world that I want to add</h4>

  <p>
    I can add maps for you if they're free to use or you own them. Hit me up on
    this
    <a href="https://forms.gle/5RRtzuv3Um5xN9Eh9"> Google Form</a>
    and I'll try to add it for you
