What is this
------------

This is a Warhammer world map sharing system inspired by the amazing maps over at gitzmansgallery.

The system allows you to view the old world, zoom in to street level in some locations, and share your art, battlemaps, and stories.

How do I add new locations?
---------------------------

1.  Login in the top left
2.  Right click a location
3.  Add some art that you think is cool for that location, and maybe some battlemaps if you have them (file size limit ~5mb)
4.  Star the image that you want to show in the preview (art works best for this)
5.  Check the box if you want to share them publically so everyone can enjoy them

If you didn't create the images, make sure to credit the artist who did!

I have a high def map of a city/part of the world that I want to add

Adding zoomable maps is not yet automated, but [use this form](https://forms.gle/5RRtzuv3Um5xN9Eh9) and I'll try to add it for you
