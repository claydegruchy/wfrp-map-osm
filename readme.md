# Hammermap
A searchable warhammer map

# Storage of map files
Map files are not stored here, but are stored in the sister repo:
https://github.com/claydegruchy/wfrp-map-storage
All maps are kept here so we don't have to load 500+ mb worth of images into gh actions every push to main.

# Something went wrong, I found [some broken shit] 
It do be like that sometimes, drop in an issue or PR and ill sort it out.

# Credits
I DO NOT OWN these maps! I give credit to the original authors:
## World map
Big thanks to gitzmansgallery for putting it together. Extract from gitzmansgallery.com:
Some original artwork is credited to Andreas Blicher, based upon Alfred Nunez, Jr.'s outstanding cartography and research. Many other sources were used including those from the Warhammer Maps page.

Distances are from Travel Distances in the Empire (and beyond) by Jackdays
