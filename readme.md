# WFRP Map
A map for WFRP or other games. Used to store battlemaps and images for games, plus give extra detail to locations

# Storage of map files
Map files are not stored here, but are stored in the sister repo:
https://github.com/claydegruchy/wfrp-map-storage
All maps are kept here so we don't have to load 500+ mb worth of images into gh actions every push to main.

# Whats the deal
This uses firebase to store images and locations uploaded to users.

# Something went wrong, i found [some broken shit]
