# Hammermap
A map for WFRP or other games. Used to store battlemaps and images for games, plus give extra detail to locations

# Storage of map files
Map files are not stored here, but are stored in the sister repo:
https://github.com/claydegruchy/wfrp-map-storage
All maps are kept here so we don't have to load 500+ mb worth of images into gh actions every push to main.

# Whats the deal
This uses firebase to store images and locations uploaded to users.

# Something went wrong, I found [some broken shit] 
It do be like that sometimes, drop in an issue or PR and ill sort it out.


# Credits
I DO NOT OWN these maps! I give credit to the original authors:

Big thanks to gitzmansgallery for putting it together. Extract from gitzmansgallery.com:
